# Madrid-EDA
Basic Exploratory Data Analysis of Madrid's Airbnb Data

## Introduction
This is the result of a Data Analysis project on Airbnb data from the Spanish city of Madrid.

## Explication
The project consists of using a csv file of the Madrid's Airbnb Data and from there cleaning the data and drawing graphs on the data.

The starting point is the consideration that there is a big problem with AirBnb rental housing and tourism in cities. We are going to work with a `dataset` to analyze this problem.

It is known that many private owners find it more profitable and lucrative to rent flats to tourists than to locals (especially in city centers), and many real estate agencies buy properties and convert them into tourist accommodation as well. All of this has the effect of reducing supply, increasing prices, and pushing local businesses to other neighborhoods, leaving only tourists in the center.

With this in mind, and knowing that Airbnb is one of the most popular online marketplaces for accommodation today, we will dig into the data for:

- On the one hand, to evaluate the impact that Airbnb has on housing (in this case, the city of Madrid is analyzed).
- On the other hand, inquire about who, when and how is rented and possibly make considerations about tourist flows.
